# Chicago-PD-Crime-Predictions

## Project Overview
Crime in Chicago has been a major concern for the Chicago Police Department (CPD). To address this issue, the CPD has been collecting data on reported crimes since 2001. This project aims to use data analytics and predictive modeling techniques to uncover insights from this dataset that can help the CPD reduce the rate of violent crimes in the city.

## Data
The project data file contains daily records of reported crimes in Chicago since 2001. The data includes information on the type of crime, the location of the crime, and the time when the crime was reported.

## Analysis
The project will conduct a full analysis of the crime data to uncover patterns and trends. This will include examining the types of crimes that are most common, the locations where crimes are most likely to occur, and the days of the week and times when crimes are most likely to be reported.

## Insights
The analysis will provide insights that can help the CPD determine what type of crimes to prepare for, where these crimes are most likely to occur, and what days of the week and periods to expect these crimes. These insights will be used to develop strategies for effectively mobilizing and responding to crimes in shorter time cycles.

## Conclusion
By using data analytics and predictive modeling techniques, this project aims to provide the CPD with valuable insights that can help reduce the rate of violent crimes in Chicago. By understanding crime patterns and equipping the police department appropriately, the CPD can work towards a safer and more secure city for all residents.
